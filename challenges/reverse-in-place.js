 * Write a function to reverse an array in place

 * such as Python and Javascript, strings are immutable, meaning they cannot
 * be changed after they're created.
 *
 * Since strings are immutable in javascript, we will be reversing an array of characters instead.

 * DO NOT USE THE BUILT IN REVERSE METHOD
